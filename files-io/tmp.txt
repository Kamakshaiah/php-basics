Edmund I (920/921–946) was King of the English from 939 until his death. He was a son of King Edward the Elder and his third wife Eadgifu, and a grandson of Alfred the Great. Edmund's predecessor and half-brother Æthelstan had become the first king of all England when he conquered Viking-ruled York in 927, but on his death Anlaf Guthfrithson seized control of York and north-east Mercia. Edmund recovered control over all England in 944. He continued his brother's friendly relations with Continental rulers; some were married to his half-sisters. Key advisers include his mother and Ealdorman Æthelstan of East Anglia, known as the Half-King because he was so powerful. Edmund actively legislated. Three of his codes survive; they regulated feuds and emphasised the sanctity of the royal person. Edmund supported the religious English Benedictine Reform in its early stages. After a deranged thief killed him in a brawl he was succeeded by his younger brother Eadred (d. 955) and two sons in succession.
